                  <h6>How many people does each villa accommodate?</h6>
                  <p>For the optimal and most comfortable Montigo Resorts experience, we encourage our guests to book for 2 to 4 people per villa. We can however, in compliance with local regulations, security and insurance policies, accommodate up to a maximum of 5 guests per villa (ie adults and children 3 years old and above).</p>

                  <p>At Montigo Resorts, we always try to accommodate your every need and make sure that you enjoy your stay with us. If the children are below 3 years of age, we are happy to make an exception. However, if you group has more than 5 people, children included, we are bounded by local restrictions on the number of guests that could stay in one villa. Your safety is our priority.</p>

                  <p>The rate for the 5th guest is S$100.00++ per villa per night inclusive of daily set breakfast. The 5th guest will be using the existing sofa either in the master bedroom or upon special request, in the living room. The extra bedding will be set-up prior to your arrival.</p>

                  <p>We wish to ensure every guest has the best experience at Montigo Resorts, which includes a comfortable night’s sleep and meals at leisure. As a result, the rate for the 5th guest is applicable regardless.</p>

If you have a 5th person (adults or children over 3 years of age) joining, please inform us at info@montigoresorts.com prior to your arrival.
