image flickering answer:

 solutions created were based on the existing framework
   - it seemed like a good answer at the beginning of the development of mobile & it was the current framework used by the desktop

   https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js
   - the framework had an built-in mobile version.

   but it was made for static sites which didn't change the section's height.
