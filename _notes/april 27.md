Ernica List

1. make sections 1 screen height
   - this is possible for screens with a height greater than the design (you can still center the text to the center of the height)
     each image will be scaled proportionately to the design


Home Psd

2. change all arrow buttons to fa-chevron-circle-right 
3. Map Functionality
   - intro animation (the trail will animate in once) - on scroll
   - text items will animate in
   (if it is possible to control the timeline of an svg element (with js & gsap))

   - use old trick (flash to canvas element)
   - export the goto And Stop function

  
   - or just go full 3D ^___^
     (or just plot each point out in raphaeljs)






Karen's List

1. Body font add 1px.




Jairus List

1. newsletter subscription functionality (save to txt)
2. make site look responsive (would atleast function on a mobile phone as a single column site)

3. create 'manic.ui.TextContainer' - with same logic as image container.
4. text alignment of main image (same)
   - use javascript instead of css

5. check if preloader animations work on other browsers ?


6. social metadata.

7. RENAME ELEMENTS
   - standardize parallax & main image sections
   - standardize circle buttons

8. standardize css ? 
  - add 30px padding to container-fluid (by customizing bootstrap)
    instead of adding 30px to each element

THINGS I WANT TO EXPLORE:

1. parallax multi-layer image
   would work for the image 'The Ultimate Escape'

2. multi-layer fade in
   (fade in foreground elements, before the bg elements)
   ex. bowl in restaurant images would fade in first before the back

1. sea activities list

* don't touch/modify the map. ernica is doing another version
* don't animate the icons
  - icon size to change later
* images are still bound to change



AUTO PILOT:

just css
create images from psd (again T_____T)
copy panel-container css from sga







sga?

1. I believe "Recipies" in header should be spelled "Recipes." "

2. photographer preloader bar (100% height)
