things to do: (there's alot, here's some of the)

//remove black thing from main_slider
//remove pinning

booking engine


// put events booking form on hold 




1. create a responsive header
2. tweak footer to be centered








MAJOR MISSING FEATURES:
 

// !! HOTEL BOOKING FUNCTIONALITY !!

 - cannot book from previous dates




  1. home page, map interactivity.
  2. rooms page, map interactivity.

 //2. book now, calendar dropdown
 //3. (mailto) links
 //4. dining menu/navigation black gradient
    home page add blue gradient ?

 //5. actual preloading (enumerate assets that are used by the page)



Optional Code Cleaning:
 //1. parallax & main image across pages.
 //2. change rooms to villas

Optional Animation
 1. parallax scene for activities, dining & rooms page
 2. 





fix gradient css opacity of each item (main slider)
fix letter spacing css of each h3 (main slider)
add the foot icon back (activities) ? or ask if it can be permanently removed.







plunk in form
 - should have reignwood js, not allow previous dates





Bugs/ Flaws
 1. text container, margin from top is too small on some aspect ratios.
    (repositioning logic doesn't function the way you wanted it to)





Ernica List

1. make sections 1 screen height
   - this is possible for screens with a height greater than the design (you can still center the text to the center of the height)
     each image will be scaled proportionately to the design

//2. change all arrow buttons to circle arrow buttons

3. make map interactive?  // don't do yet. might be removed...

Home Psd

//2. change all arrow buttons to fa-chevron-circle-right 
3. Map Functionality
   - intro animation (the trail will animate in once) - on scroll
   - text items will animate in
   (if it is possible to control the timeline of an svg element (with js & gsap))

   - use old trick (flash to canvas element)
   - export the goto And Stop function

  
   - or just go full 3D ^___^
     (or just plot each point out in raphaeljs)






Karen's List

//1. Body font add 1px. // this is to ernica's version, i think the design has been changed.




Jairus List

1. newsletter subscription functionality (save to txt)
2. make site look responsive (would atleast function on a mobile phone as a single column site)

//3. create 'manic.ui.TextContainer' - with same logic as image container.
//4. text alignment of main image (same)
//   - use javascript instead of css

5. check if preloader animations work on other browsers ?


6. social metadata.

//7. RENAME ELEMENTS
//   - standardize parallax & main image sections
//   - standardize circle buttons



8. standardize css ? 
  - add 30px padding to container-fluid (by customizing bootstrap)
    instead of adding 30px to each element



9. the footer might not be as the psd is?



http://greensock.com/multipletextshadows ? 


(you might want to do this in a seperate html (aka, not the one you are working on) )
THINGS I WANT TO EXPLORE:

1. parallax multi-layer image
   would work for the image 'The Ultimate Escape'

2. multi-layer fade in
   (fade in foreground elements, before the bg elements)
   ex. bowl in restaurant images would fade in first before the back

3. If it would be possible to handwrite the titles
   'Dining at Montigo' to animate like a pen writing the text

4. image animate in
   - as you scroll all the images animate in, so we can explore options on how this happens
   1. like sword art online, intro.
     the image comes from  the white bg (image slides in like it is reverse imbosed from the page)

5. intro animation for home images
   - it zooms in to the image (multiple layer image)
     layers would scale proportionally into the image




6. dining.php
   - private dining image (add flickering light looping svg)
     - create 3 variations




Suyeon's List

activities page: 

//1. the call to action sentence will be 14px and line height 18px
//   and for the arrow circle can we make it 12px?

//2. black gradient 40 alpha



Activities Psd

//1. sea activities list
//   defaults 'description view'
//   when you press 'see more sea activities', it will open the 'list view'

Rooms Psd

//1. the 'Our Villas' section will have synchronized text slider and image slider
//2. also the parallax image in 'The Residences'




//3. the gradient under the menu has changed (there are 2 layers of black)

4. all main image text must be centralized
5. all main image gradient must SCALE!!




//* don't touch/modify the map. ernica is doing another version
//* don't animate the icons
//  - icon size to change later
//* images are still bound to change







sga?

1. I believe "Recipies" in header should be spelled "Recipes." "

2. photographer preloader bar (100% height)
   - center to screen

3. possible fix for people section dying 
 - slow down creation of html ?

















april 29,
 - need to re-export parallax images
   - has a gradient taining the main image...

 

 use '.parallax-section-text' on rooms.php & activities.php
