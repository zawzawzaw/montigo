    - use fixed 50 px below seafront perfection
    - use 50px after first row of restaurant image
    - 50 px margin bottom after 2nd row

    - if you shrink the browser window width below the 'accomodation map' fixed width (1280px) a horizontal scrollbar appears

    - event form, date picker doesn't have functionality:

      if you select an arrival date & departure date is already selected & less than arrival date, departure date resets

    - event form, add close button

7. faq

    fadein transition in effect, not applied to elements beyond 10th element (just add more css declarations)

    - on scroll down 'see our frequently asked question' cta still visible (doesn't turn invisible)

1. cross-browser checking (?)
  mac safari
  //IE 11
  IE 10

2. responsive website

 -->

1. floor plan animation
   - create manic component (swiffy json loader)
   - extend class (for this and the accomodations map)


2. home instagram sidebar
   - json loader
   - animate in on
      a. scroll position = okay
      b. images are loaded.             // this will not happen cause the thing is preloaded....

   - place holders need to be there (grey boxes), so while images are animating in, there is no extra white space.

3. create more powerful 'default' page
     remove js page for those that don't need one.

4. replace icons with svg instead of png     (lower filesize, vector cleaner / non-pixelated look)
   - remove png from preloader asset list
   - create font files ?

5. compress js (last last item)
  - add date picker to libraries                                                                            // IMPORTANT






6. create more powerful image container
  - publish this on git !!
  - needs max_y as well (border 50)


7. add fade to white, on page unload (if possible, not sure how...)
