1. parallax multi-layer image
   (for parallax images, not home page images)

2. multi-layer fade in
   (fade in foreground elements, before the bg elements)
   ex. bowl in restaurant images would fade in first before the back

3. If it would be possible to handwrite the titles
   'Dining at Montigo' to animate like a pen writing the text

4. image animate in
   - as you scroll all the images animate in, so we can explore options on how this happens
   1. like sword art online, intro.
     the image comes from  the white bg (image slides in like it is reverse imbosed from the page)

5. intro animation for home images
   - it zooms in to the image (multiple layer image)
     layers would scale proportionally into the image     

6. dining.php
   - private dining image (add flickering light looping svg)
     - create 3 variations
