Hi Team, 

Thanks for your time just now (and on the project)!

Jai, here is your list. Suyeon, I have mentioned you in area where your consultation would be needed:

    // Villa page: Replace ‘won’t you stay with us’ to ‘Come stay with us’ 
    // Menu & Footer: Change ‘villas’ to ‘accommodation’ (if too long, remove ‘contact’, but in menu bar only). Suyeon will decide if it’s too long or not. 
    // Monday: Will be presented on PC using Chrome (so must check that it works on that setup)
    // Spa page: Change title from ‘proprietary treatments’ to ‘rituals & therapies’ 
    //Lower HP icons: Change ‘terrestrial explorations’ to ‘outdoor activities’ (same for activities page title too) 
    //Activities: Change page ranking so outdoor activities is 1st and sea activities is 2nd (Sports & Fitness is 3rd)     
    //We are going to change the ‘early bird summer getaway image’ (attached, use same framing as current image) 
    

Thanks guys, appreciate your efforts with this. 

Josh

1. parallax multi-layer image
   (for parallax images, not home page images)

2. multi-layer fade in
   (fade in foreground elements, before the bg elements)
   ex. bowl in restaurant images would fade in first before the back

3. If it would be possible to handwrite the titles
   'Dining at Montigo' to animate like a pen writing the text

4. image animate in
   - as you scroll all the images animate in, so we can explore options on how this happens
   1. like sword art online, intro.
     the image comes from  the white bg (image slides in like it is reverse imbosed from the page)

5. intro animation for home images
   - it zooms in to the image (multiple layer image)
     layers would scale proportionally into the image     

6. dining.php
   - private dining image (add flickering light looping svg)
     - create 3 variations
